# Information from 'Python Crash Course, A Hands-on, Project - Based Introduction to programming
# By Eric Matthes

# Chapter 1, Intro just contained how to set python up
# You really just go on the Python website, download the latest version
# I would recommend an IDE rather than terminal, or even just an online compiler

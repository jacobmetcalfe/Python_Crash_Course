# Chapter 4: Working With Lists

# Looping through a list
magicians = ['alice', 'david', 'carolina']
for magician in magicians:
    print(magician)
# Defines magician as part of magicians and prints each magician for each iteration of the list until the list is done

for magician in magicians:
    print(magician.title() + ", that was a great trick!")
# Every indented line following is considered part of the loop

for magician in magicians:
    print(magician.title() + ", that was a great trick!")
    print("I can't wait to see your next trick, " + magician.title() + ".\n")

# Summarizes the solution
print("Thanks for showing your tricks guys!")

# If you don't indent then you will get an error
# Example
# for magician in magicians
# print(magician)

# This is a syntax error
# A logical error gives a result, however it is not the desired result.
# Syntax errors are easy to resolve, logical errors can take a long time to resolve
# You can also indent when unnecessary producing unexpected indent error
# If you forget to indent, that would be a logical error
# If you forget the colon at the end of the first line of the loop you will get a syntax error

# Examples 4-1. Pizzas: Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza. Store these pizza names in a list,
# and then use a for loop to print the name of each pizza. Modify your for loop to print a sentence using the name of
# the pizza instead of printing just the name of the pizza. For each pizza you should have one line of output
# containing a simple statement like I like pepperoni pizza. Add a line at the end of your program, outside the for
# loop, that states how much you like pizza. The output should consist of three or more lines about the kinds of
# pizza you like and then an additional sentence, such as I really love pizza!
pizzas = ['pepperoni', 'pineapple', 'sausage']
for pizza in pizzas:

# 4-2. Animals: Think of at least three
# different animals that have a common characteristic. Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for
# loop to print out the name of each animal. Modify your program to print a statement about each animal,
# such as A dog would make a great pet. Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in
# common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!

# 4-4. One Million: Make a list of the numbers from one to one million, and then use a for loop to print the numbers.
# (If the output is taking too long, stop it by pressing ctrl-C or by closing the output window.)
# Would ruin code if I ran it
million = list(range(1, 1000001))

# 4-5. Summing a Million: Make a list of the numbers from one to one million, and then use min() and max() to make
# sure your list actually starts at one and ends at one million. Also, use the sum() function to see how quickly
# Python can add a million numbers.

# 4-8. Cubes: A number raised to the third power is called a cube. For example, the cube of 2 is written as 2**3 in

# to print out the value of each cube.

# Slicing a list

# Examples 4-10. Slices: Using one of the programs you wrote in this chapter, add several lines to the end of the
# program that do the following: Print the message, The first three items in the list are:. Then use a slice to print
# the first three items from that programs list. Print the message, Three items from the middle of the list are:.
# Use a slice to print three items from the middle of the list. Print the message, The last three items in the list
# are:. Use a slice to print the last three items in the list.

# 4-11. My Pizzas, Your Pizzas: Start with your program from Exercise 4-1 (page 60). Make a copy of the list of
# pizzas, and call it friend_pizzas. Then, do the following: Add a new pizza to the original list. Add a different
# pizza to the list friend_pizzas. Prove that you have two separate lists. Print the message, My favorit epizzas
# are:, and then use a for loop to print the first list. Print the message, My friend√≠s favorite pizzas are:,
# and then use a for loop to print the second list. Make sure each new pizza is stored in the appropriate list.

# 4-12. More Loops: All versions of foods.py in this section have avoided using for loops when printing to save
# space. Choose a version of foods.py, and write two for loops to print each list of foods.

# Tuples
# A tuple is a list that cannot be changed, making it immutable
# A tuple looks similar except you use parentheses instead

# Examples
# 4-13. Buffet: A buffet-style restaurant offers only five basic foods. Think of five simple foods,
# and store them in a tuple. Use a for loop to print each food the restaurant offers. Try to modify one of the items,
# and make sure that Python rejects the change. The restaurant changes its menu, replacing two of the items with
# different foods. Add a block of code that rewrites the tuple, and then use a for loop to print each of the items on
# the revised menu.
buffet_foods = ('pizza', 'sushi', 'crab legs', 'rice')

# Styling your code
# Write neat code
# The Style Guide
# When someone wants to make a change to the Python language, they write a Python Enhancement Proposal(PEP)
# Basically just said write neat code, in which if you have a good IDE it should do anyways
# If not, make sure you include blank lines, four lines per indentation, and 80 characters per line.
